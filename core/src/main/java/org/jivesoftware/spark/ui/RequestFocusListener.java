/**
 *  Convenience class to request focus on a component.
 *
 *  When the component is added to a realized Window then component will
 *  request focus immediately, since the ancestorAdded event is fired
 *  immediately.
 *
 *  When the component is added to a non realized Window, then the focus
 *  request will be made once the window is realized, since the
 *  ancestorAdded event will not be fired until then.
 *
 *  Using the default constructor will cause the listener to be removed
 *  from the component once the AncestorEvent is generated. A second constructor
 *  allows you to specify a boolean value of false to prevent the
 *  AncestorListener from being removed when the event is generated. This will
 *  allow you to reuse the listener each time the event is generated.
