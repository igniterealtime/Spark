Building a Sparkplug

To easily build a Sparkplug, we have added a simple ANT script to create a deployed plug.  To create, do the following:

1) Copy your java source files to the src directory.
2) Place any dependencies (besides Spark) into the lib directory.
3) Update the plugin.xml file to represent your plugin.
4) Go to the build directory, and type ant jar to build your plugin or
.... type "ant run" to build and deploy your plugin directly to Spark and
have Spark startup to test your plugin right away.

Your new plugin will be called myplugin.jar.  

If you wish to deploy your plugin later, just copy your new myplugin.jar to the plugins directory of your Sparkplug distro kit.

Enjoy!
